# Veera Coding Challenge
60 min live coding challenge for Engineering Interviews

## Problem statement
1. When a message is sent, it takes a while for the message to show up in the message field. This is particularly noticible when large files are shared. 
2. Fix the logic so that the message appears instantly in the message field.
3. Bonus for extra points: Show an indicator next to the message showing the message being sent.

## Steps
1. Download the source code
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `cd ios && pod install` to install pods if you're running on iOS simulator
4. Run `npm run ios` for iOS or `npm run android` for android to launch the app.
